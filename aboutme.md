<p align="justify"> I am a <b>Post-Doc Scientist</b> at Microsoft Research Lab, Cambridge, working in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/mixed-reality-ai-lab-cambridge/">Mixed Reality and AI Lab</a>. I completed a <b>PhD</b> in Machine Learning for Astronomy at Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics (<a href="http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/">JBCA</a>), the University of Manchester. I worked under the supervision of Prof. Benjamin Stappers and Dr <a href="http://www.scienceguyrob.com/">Rob Lyon</a> and my PhD research was supported by UK Newton Fund as part of the Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy (<a href="https://www.darabigdata.com/">DARA Big Data</a>) project. My research interests include developing automated pipeline using machine learning for classification purposes in image domain (Computer Vision) & time domain Astronomy (temporal analysis) and in imbalanced machine learning problems. I am also a <a href="https://www.womentech.net/global-ambassadors/United%20Kingdom/Zafiirah/Hosenie">Global Ambassador</a> at <a href="https://www.womentech.net/">WomenTech network</a>. </p>
  
<p align="justify">In addition, I have a strong zeal in developing machine learning algorithms for sustainability development using geospatial data. More specifically tackling climate change problems, for instance, land cover mapping problems, risk analysis of certain regions using geospatial images (flooding, heatwaves, wildfires ...) and performing temporal anaylsis of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission at various geolocations using satellite data.</p>


<p align="justify">Moreover, I also undertake some Natural Language Process (NLP) projects involving automated process of understanding and interpreting unstructured data, for example, 
  - sentences & word count, 
  - frequency of unique word, 
  - N-grams: use of content-tagging & word prediction,
  - Text scoring: output polarity & subjectivity.</p>


### My Background

<p align="justify"> 
Born in Mauritius, a tropical and paradise Island, I did my undergraduate studies in Physics at the University of Mauritius. Afterwards, I have been awarded two prestigious awards: the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and North-West University Master bursaries, where I embarked on an MSc in Astrophysics and Space Science at the University of Cape Town and North-West University.

### Experience

#### 1. Machine Learning Researcher (May 2018 - April 2021)
The University of Manchester

My research mainly focuses on the development of various machine learning softwares that can quickly and efficiently provide classification labels for several new object classification challenges for large-scale surveys. These softwares are integrated in optical (MeerLICHT) and radio (MeerKAT) telescopes. This is fundamentally important for various reasons. These surveys are already generating from petabytes to exabytes of data per day, therefore, it is crucial to have a rapid follow-up of detected objects and analysing most interesting candidates. Sifting through the gigantesque of data will be almost impossible for astronomers, therefore ML is helpful in reducing the human-labour which are admittedly error-prone and decreases the computational complexity.
