<p style='text-align: justify;'>I am currently a PhD Candidate at Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics (JBCA), the University of Manchester, working under the supervision of Prof. Benjamin Stappers and Dr Rob Lyon. My PhD research is supported by UK Newton Fund as part of the Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy (DARA) Big Data project. My research interests include developing automated pipeline using machine learning for classification purposes in image domain (Computer Vision) \& time domain Astronomy(temporal analysis) and in imbalanced machine learning problem. In addition, I have a strong zeal in developing algorithms to tackle climate change problems, for instance, land cover mapping problems, risk analysis of certain regions using geospatial images (flooding, heatwaves, wildfires ...) and performing temporal anaylsis of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission at various geolocations using satellite data.</p>

### My Backgroound

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Born in Mauritius, a tropical and paradise Island, I did my undergraduate studies in Physics at the University of Mauritius. Following the prestigious award, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Master bursary, I embarked on an MSc in Astrophysics and Space Science at the University of Cape Town and North-West University.
