<p align="justify"> I am a <b>Post-Doc Scientist</b> at Microsoft Research Lab, Cambridge, working in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/mixed-reality-ai-lab-cambridge/">Mixed Reality and AI</a> field. I have completed a <b>PhD</b> in Machine Learning for Astronomy at Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics (<a href="http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/">JBCA</a>), the University of Manchester. I worked under the supervision of Prof. Benjamin Stappers and Dr <a href="http://www.scienceguyrob.com/">Rob Lyon</a> and my PhD research was supported by UK Newton Fund as part of the Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy (<a href="https://www.darabigdata.com/">DARA Big Data</a>) project. My research interests include developing automated pipeline using machine learning for classification purposes in image domain (Computer Vision) & time domain Astronomy (temporal analysis) and in imbalanced machine learning problems. I am also a <a href="https://www.womentech.net/global-ambassadors/United%20Kingdom/Zafiirah/Hosenie">Global Ambassador</a> at <a href="https://www.womentech.net/">WomenTech network</a>. </p>
  
<p align="justify">In addition, I have a strong zeal in developing machine learning algorithms for sustainability development using geospatial data. More specifically tackling climate change problems, for instance, land cover mapping problems, risk analysis of certain regions using geospatial images (flooding, heatwaves, wildfires ...) and performing temporal anaylsis of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission at various geolocations using satellite data.</p>


<p align="justify">Moreover, I also undertake some Natural Language Process (NLP) projects involving automated process of understanding and interpreting unstructured data, for example, 
  - sentences & word count, 
  - frequency of unique word, 
  - N-grams: use of content-tagging & word prediction,
  - Text scoring: output polarity & subjectivity.</p>


### My Background

<p align="justify"> 
Born in Mauritius, a tropical and paradise Island, I did my undergraduate studies in Physics at the University of Mauritius. Afterwards, I have been awarded two prestigious awards: the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and North-West University Master bursaries, where I embarked on an MSc in Astrophysics and Space Science at the University of Cape Town and North-West University.

### Experience

#### <span style="color:blue"> ***1. Consultant: Lead Data Scientist (Nov 2019 - Jan 2021) - Arcturus ESG Ltd, London UK***</span>

<p align="justify"> A FinTech firm: analysing and evaluating climate, sustainability and the associated financial risks using machine learning to generate actionable insights from vast data sets. </p>

<b>Project 1: Pixel-wise classification using machine learning techniques</b>
- Use the Landsat 8 Surface reflectance data (30m resolution).
- Using Quantum Geographic Information system (QGIS) to annotate pixels in the images into categories, water, farm, forest...
- Feature Engineering approaches: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Normalized Difference Build-Up Index (NDBI).
- Use Random Forest algorithm and perform classification.

<b>Project 2: Analysing Greenhouse Gas emission over point locations</b>

- Use Sentinel 5P dataset.
- Develop an automated pipeline to query data for Greenhouse Gas emission at point coordinates using Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform.
- Develop a machine learning approach using Gaussian Process for analysing the variation in greenhouse gas emission over a period of time. Uncertainty quantification is an important output from the model.

<b>Project 3: Exploring World Resource Institute (WRI) Data</b>

- Query global power plant, more specifically oil, gas and coal power plants.
- Develop a name-matching algorithm using Natural Language processing (NLP) techniques to match names of global power plants from WRI data to CDP Climate Change questionnaire. Based on the scoring, extract power plant capacity.
- Compute Emission intensity for each power plant. Assign a Grading level to each plant based on the emission intensity.

<b>Project 4: Time-series analysis for Temperature Anomaly</b>

#### <span style="color:blue"> ***2. Machine Learning Researcher (May 2018 - April 2021) - The University of Manchester, Manchester UK***</span>

<p align="justify"> My research was mainly focused on the development of various machine learning softwares that can quickly and efficiently provide classification labels for several new object classification challenges for large-scale surveys. These softwares are integrated in optical (MeerLICHT) and radio (MeerKAT) telescopes. This is fundamentally important for various reasons. These surveys are already generating from petabytes to exabytes of data per day, therefore, it is crucial to have a rapid follow-up of detected objects and analysing most interesting candidates. Sifting through the gigantesque of data will be almost impossible for astronomers, therefore ML is helpful in reducing the human-labour which are admittedly error-prone and decreases the computational complexity. </p>
