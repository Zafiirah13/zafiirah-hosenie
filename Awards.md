## First Prize for Institute of Physics Computational Physics Group Thesis Prize
<p align="justify"> I was awarded the <a href="https://compphysics.org/2022/12/06/zafiirah-hosenie-awarded-iop-cpg-thesis-prize/">IoP CPG Thesis Prize</a>. The prize was awarded to recognise my PhD research, which used machine learning techniques to detect challenges arising from the large data volumes that are prevalent in modern astronomy. Algorithms developed from this research have been successfully deployed at the MeerKAT radio telescope array and the MeerLICHT optical telescope, both located in South Africa.</p>

## Grand Prize Winner - Microsoft Global Hackathon 2021
<p align="justify"> Microsoft organised this Hackathon and it was kicked off in all regions of the globe and thousands of employees were hacking with colleagues, nonprofits, and customers, tapping into creativity, inspiration, and the power of collaboration. I had the opportunity to participate and work in collaboration with other team members on a particular project for three days. By the end, I was absolutely delighted, and very proud, to see that our project had won the <b>overall Grand Prize </b> this year!.

## PhD Scholarship - Newton Fund UK
<p align="justify"> I have been awarded the <a href="https://www.darabigdata.com/">DARA Big Data</a> PhD Schorlarship - this is a competitive scholarship as it was awarded to only three candidates.
  
DARA Big Data’s remit is to equip students in those 8 countries with the skills to translate and analyse the huge amounts of data that will be produced by the telescope. These skills are applicable in many other areas; training covers not only astronomy but also agriculture, medical sciences and data-driven policy-making. The project is led by Prof Anna Scaife of the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics (JBCA) at the University of Manchester, and works collaboratively with partner organisations in South Africa and Universities across the UK (Leeds, Hertfordshire, Sussex, York). 

The project's aim is to ensure that African students can participate fully in the technological advances of what is often called the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR); the rapid global shift that extensively uses AI, robotics and the billions of smart devices connected to the ‘Internet of Things’.
