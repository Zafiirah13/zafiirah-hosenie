<p align="justify"> I was awarded the <a href="https://compphysics.org/2022/12/06/zafiirah-hosenie-awarded-iop-cpg-thesis-prize/">IoP CPG Thesis Prize</a>. The prize was awarded to recognise my PhD research, which used machine learning techniques to detect challenges arising from the large data volumes that are prevalent in modern astronomy. Algorithms developed from this research have been successfully deployed at the MeerKAT radio telescope array and the MeerLICHT optical telescope, both located in South Africa.</p>

<p align="justify"> Microsoft organised this Hackathon and it was kicked off in all regions of the globe and thousands of employees were hacking with colleagues, nonprofits, and customers, tapping into creativity, inspiration, and the power of collaboration.
