## Google Sandbox
<p align="justify">  <a href="https://events.withgoogle.com/sandbox-manchester-united-kingdom/#content">Google Sandbox</a> was organised on the 8<sup>th</sup> February 2020. It was a great experience in attending this event where I have learnt a lot about several topics, for instance, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), using containers in Kubernetes Engine among others. In addition, I had the oppportunity to participate in one of the hands-on workshop: <b>Kubernetes workshop: Orchestrating the Cloud with Kubernetes</b>. In the latter, it was my first experience with deploying containers, provisioning a complete Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes Engine and then breaking the application down into Microservices.</p>
