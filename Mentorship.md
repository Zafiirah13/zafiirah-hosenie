## Project 1B Cambridge
<p align="justify"> I was awarded the <a href="https://compphysics.org/2022/12/06/zafiirah-hosenie-awarded-iop-cpg-thesis-prize/">IoP CPG Thesis Prize</a>. The prize was awarded to recognise my PhD research, which used machine learning techniques to detect challenges arising from the large data volumes that are prevalent in modern astronomy. Algorithms developed from this research have been successfully deployed at the MeerKAT radio telescope array and the MeerLICHT optical telescope, both located in South Africa.</p>

## Big Data Mauritius
<p align="justify"> Microsoft organised this Hackathon and it was kicked off in all regions of the globe and thousands of employees were hacking with colleagues, nonprofits, and customers, tapping into creativity, inspiration, and the power of collaboration. I had the opportunity to participate and work in collaboration with other team members on a particular project for three days. By the end, I was absolutely delighted, and very proud, to see that our project had won the <b>overall Grand Prize </b> this year!. The badge can be accessed on <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/dcc85600-ceef-495b-9fd0-0c332171658c">Global Hackathon 2021 Grand Prize Winner</a>.</p>

## Africa Women in Data Science
<p align="justify"> I have been awarded the <a href="https://www.darabigdata.com/">DARA Big Data</a> PhD Schorlarship - this is a competitive scholarship as it was awarded to only three candidates.
  
DARA Big Data’s remit is to equip students in those 8 countries with the skills to translate and analyse the huge amounts of data that will be produced by the telescope. These skills are applicable in many other areas; training covers not only astronomy but also agriculture, medical sciences and data-driven policy-making. The project is led by Prof Anna Scaife of the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics (JBCA) at the University of Manchester, and works collaboratively with partner organisations in South Africa and Universities across the UK (Leeds, Hertfordshire, Sussex, York). 

The project's aim is to ensure that African students can participate fully in the technological advances of what is often called the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR); the rapid global shift that extensively uses AI, robotics and the billions of smart devices connected to the ‘Internet of Things’.

## 3rd Big Data Africa School, Cape Town, 6 - 16 Oct 2019
<p align="justify"> The 3rd Big Data Africa School 2019, organised by <a href="https://www.sarao.ac.za/media-releases/sarao-upskilling-africas-bright-young-minds-in-big-data/">SARAO</a>, introduced fundamental data science tools and techniques to 25 talented young science and engineering graduates from South Africa and the 8 SKA Africa Partner countries. The School aims to develop student skills in working with extremely large datasets in any given research environment.

In the school, I was mentoring a group of students, working on sustainable agriculture project. Each day we brainstormed the project and split the tasks among the students. They worked over a period of six days to solve  the assigned problems using real life datasets, culminating in a day where they presented their findings to a panel of experts and their fellow attendees.
