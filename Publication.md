My name is Zafiirah Hosenie. Born in Mauritius, a tropical and paradise Island, I did my undergraduate studies in Physics at the University of Mauritius. Following the prestigious award, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Master bursary, I embarked on an MSc in Astrophysics and Space Science at the University of Cape Town and North-West University. In April 2018, I started my PhD studies at Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics (JBCA), the University of Manchester, under the supervision of Prof. Benjamin Stappers and Dr Rob Lyon. My PhD research is supported by UK Newton Fund as part of the Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy (DARA) Big Data project.
