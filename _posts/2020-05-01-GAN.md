title: Generative Adversarial Network as a Simulator?
---
# FRI-FRII-Simulation-using-DCGAN

Implementaion of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network using [DCGAN in Tensorflow](https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow) code. Detailed information can be found in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434). 

FRI and FRII sources are rare candidates. To be able to apply convolutional neural network for classification of these two sources, one needs to gather a large amount of data. Using real data of FRI and FRII sources, DCGAN has been used as a simulator. Here are examples of generated FRI and FRII sources after training the DCGAN network. This work has been submitted as part of my Master thesis: [Source classification in deep radio surveys using machine learning techniques](https://repository.nwu.ac.za/handle/10394/31250).
